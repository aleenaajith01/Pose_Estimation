# Pose_Estimation

Pose estimation using 𝐔𝐥𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬 typically involves 𝐘𝐎𝐋𝐎 (You Only Look Once) models, which have been extended to support key point detection for pose estimation. The Ultralytics YOLO models are designed to be fast and accurate, making them a popular choice for real-time applications like detecting and tracking the human's actions

Some of the real-life applications of Pose Estimation are Sports Analytics for Tracking athlete movements, Healthcare for Monitoring patient rehabilitation exercises, and Human-Computer Interaction for Enhancing gesture recognition systems.
